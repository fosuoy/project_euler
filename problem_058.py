            Starting with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way, a
            square spiral with side length 7 is formed.

            It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom
            right diagonal, but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13
            numbers lying along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of
            8/13 â‰ˆ 62%.

            If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a
            square spiral with side length 9 will be formed. If this process is
            continued, what is the side length of the square spiral for which
            the ratio of primes along both diagonals first falls below 10%?
