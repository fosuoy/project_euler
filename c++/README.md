Hopefully there should be nothing in here that does not use standard libraries.
Most of this is currently standard C, C++ solutions have the file extension cpp.
The instructions for compiling / running are the same for C / C++.

To quickly run things here, try:
`TEMPLATE="problem_001" ; make ${TEMPLATE} ; ./${TEMPLATE} ; rm ${TEMPLATE}`

Assuming you're using bash
